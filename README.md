# Roman Bot

Roman Bot is a next-generation **Discord security bot** built with the clear goal of surpassing Wick and Bleed in speed, safety, and reliability.  
It follows a **North Star architecture**: modular, security-first, explainable actions, privacy-by-design, and operator-ready from day one.
